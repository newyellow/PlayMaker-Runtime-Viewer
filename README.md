# PlayMaker-Runtime-Viewer
This project shows Playmaker states in runtime, make Unity works like QLab.  
  
I use Unity an performing area, linked some sensors to make realtime rendering.  
Playmaker makes performing flow manageable, I use a lot in my performing programes.  
So make Playmaker states viewable in runtime make things easier.
